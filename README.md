# Voting-app-using-Dockers-and-kubernetes
## Multicloud Strategy Using Dockers and Kubernetes
This cloud-native web application is built using a mix of technologies. It's designed to be accessible to users via the internet, allowing them to vote for their preferred programming language out of six choices: C#, Python, JavaScript, Go, Java, and NodeJS.<br>
## Technical Stack
1.Frontend: The frontend of this application is built using React and JavaScript. It provides a responsive and user-friendly interface for casting votes.<br>

2.Backend and API: The backend of this application is powered by Go (Golang). It serves as the API handling user voting requests. MongoDB is used as the database backend, configured with a replica set for data redundancy and high availability.<br>

## Dockers and Kubernetes Resources
To deploy and manage this application effectively, we leverage Kubernetes and a variety of its resources:<br>

1.Namespace: Kubernetes namespaces are utilized to create isolated environments for different components of the application, ensuring separation and organization.<br>

2.Secret: Kubernetes secrets store sensitive information, such as API keys or credentials, required by the application securely.<br>

3.Deployment: Kubernetes deployments define how many instances of the application should run and provide instructions for updates and scaling.<br>

4.Service: Kubernetes services ensure that users can access the application by directing incoming traffic to the appropriate instances.<br>

5.StatefulSet: For components requiring statefulness, such as the MongoDB replica set, Kubernetes StatefulSets are employed to maintain order and unique identities.<br>

PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim: These Kubernetes resources manage the storage required for the application, ensuring data persistence and scalability.

# Learning Opportunities
Creating and deploying this cloud-native web voting application with Kubernetes offers a valuable learning experience. Here are some key takeaways:<br>

1.Containerization: Gain hands-on experience with containerization technologies like Docker for packaging applications and their dependencies.<br>

2.Kubernetes Orchestration: Learn how to leverage Kubernetes to efficiently manage, deploy, and scale containerized applications in a production environment.<br>

3.Microservices Architecture: Explore the benefits and challenges of a microservices architecture, where the frontend and backend are decoupled and independently scalable.<br>

4.Database Replication: Understand how to set up and manage a MongoDB replica set for data redundancy and high availability.<br>

5.Security and Secrets Management: Learn best practices for securing sensitive information using Kubernetes secrets.<br>

6.Stateful Applications: Gain insights into the nuances of deploying stateful applications within a container orchestration environment.<br>

7.Persistent Storage: Understand how Kubernetes manages and provisions persistent storage for applications with state.<br>

8.By working through this project, you'll develop a deeper understanding of cloud-native application development, containerization, Kubernetes, and the various technologies involved in building and deploying modern web applications.<br>
